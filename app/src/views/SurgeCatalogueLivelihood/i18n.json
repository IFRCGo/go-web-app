        "catalogueLivelihoodDetail": "IFRC operates within the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework and has identified 5 types of Livelihoods assistance: 1. provisioning for lost livelihoods sources (basic needs assistance), 2. livelihoods recovery including replacement of lost Livelihoods assets, 3. livelihoods strengthening, 4. livelihoods diversification and 5. livelihoods protection. In Surge context, interventions will first focus on meeting basic needs through livelihoods provisioning, which includes that immediate food and nutrition needs are met (typically through in-kind support, cash or voucher assistance). Meanwhile other activities can be designed aiming at preventing further erosion of productive assets (livelihoods protection) or supporting the recovery of livelihoods through assets’ replacement and skills strengthening.",
