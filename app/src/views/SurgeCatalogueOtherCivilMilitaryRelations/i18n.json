However, the modus operandi of these mechanisms should be well regulated and coordinated with humanitarian organisations who share the same space. Disaster responses increasingly have a domestic and/or international military/police component that interact with RCRC Movement components responding on the ground. This necessitates a clear and common approach to Civil-Military Relations (CMR) by Red Cross Red Crescent (RCRC) Movement components to ensure a principled and effective response. Where the level of interaction with armed actors is (or can be expected to be) high, then the deployment of a CMR Coordinator is recommended.",
