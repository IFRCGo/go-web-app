The IFRC partnership and resource mobilisation function provides support to the operational leadership, through engagement with partners and donors, coordination of contributions, resource mobilisation efforts, and pledge management, among others. In addition, the function may support National Societies in building their capacities to develop domestic fundraising portfolios. The IFRC also coordinates global initiatives when the IFRC is best placed to do so.",
