Aerial imagery can serve as a broad and comprehensive tool to communicate the impact of certain disasters to a general audience. UAV collected imagery has a significant and timely impact with the media and broader public when used as a communication tool immediately post disaster.",

        "otherUAVEmergencyListItemTwo": "UAVs can be used to systematically collect a large number of aerial images that can then be stitched together using processing software generating an operational field map. Mapping of affected areas can provide an important input for assessment and planning, as well as for establishing a baseline for recovery programs. Various limitations mean that mapping can cover smaller areas such as communities and will not cover an entire disaster-affected region.",
