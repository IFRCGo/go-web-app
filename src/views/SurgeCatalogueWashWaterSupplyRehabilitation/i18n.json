        "washCapacityTextOne": "To support host National Societies to assess and deliver water supply to populations affected by disasters/crisis through rehabilitation and, if necessary, establishment of new water supply infrastructure. The Water Supply Rehabilitation (WSR) ERU consists of a small team of specialised delegates with limited equipment, able to support a host National Society to rapidly assess the state of the existing water system and improve the system. The WSR can be deployed for up to 4 months and able to transition into longer term recovery though earlier withdrawal remains an option. The interventions of the WSR ERU aims with shorter-term interventions to improve existing water systems serving past the immediate emergency phase. The number of people that can be served by the WSR is not predefined and depends on the capacity and status of the existing water system but is primarily intended for larger scale operations.",

        "emergencyServicesDetail": "The WSR ERU module is flexible to provide the appropriate response for different context and select the personnel with the right combination and balance of RC/RC and professional experience to implement its activities:",
        "emergencyServicesSectionOne": "Rapid damage assessment of the pre-existing water system and its management, feasibility study, planning, design, and implementation of water system repair/rehabilitation. The WSR focusses on quick implementation and the selection of environmentally feasible, affordable and durable technical solutions. It will ensure that distinct needs and realities of women, men, and vulnerable groups are reflected in decision making.",
        "emergencyServicesSectionTwo": "Planning, design, implementation and monitoring of hygiene promotion activities with an achievable function: 1) focus on establishing and/or supporting, where appropriate, community water management structures such as water committees contributing to sustainability of water supply systems, including assessment, and 2) community mobilisation and hygiene information, education and communication targeted at promoting protective hygiene behaviour and proper set up of community accountability systems.",
        "designedFor": "Designed For",
        "designedForItemOne": "The WSR can respond to a range of disasters such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, or large displacements of people, as well as slow-onset disasters such as droughts, to areas affected by protracted crisis and WASH related disease outbreaks. The WSR can be deployed to settings where other water ERUs are not deployed, alongside other ERUs (M15/M40/HWTS) and can continue past other ERUs. The type of rehabilitation or construction depends on the context (rural, peri-urban, camps) and the type of existing water system and includes improving abstraction (pumping), treatment or protection of water sources as well as improving storage and distribution systems. The WSR in support of NS can draw upon a full range of mechanism beyond direct delivery i.e. use indirect delivery; hire of contractors, daily labour payments, work with Govt/water utilities to re-establish or improve damaged/degraded water systems. Each water system needs to be managed and to improve a system the WSR will work with those who are managing or have a responsibility for the system.",
