        "otherOverviewDetail": "In recent years, there has been shift in the type of disasters that the RCRC Movement is responding to. There are more protracted crises, including silent and forgotten disasters. Of equal concern are smaller and medium sized disasters that constitute most of the events globally. Patterns of climate change are contributing to increased vulnerability and risk, not only in times of disaster but in relation to already existing issues including health and nutrition, food security, access to safe water and water-borne diseases, protection, gender and inclusion, among others. As a consequence, additional funding is required to meet the increased needs. Additional dedicated resources are necessary to not only raise awareness and funding for emergency operations but also to strengthen the fundraising capacity of National Societies during emergencies and their collective accountability and donor stewardship. As part of our efforts to strengthen resilience and mainstream vulnerability and risk reduction within emergency and recovery operations, the Disaster Risk Reduction surge personnel available to be deployed alongside recovery surge personnel to ensure the long term action are taking into consideration and suitably addressed and included in assessment, planning and programming, where appropriate to no regenerate new risk and take active measure to increase resilience at community level.",
