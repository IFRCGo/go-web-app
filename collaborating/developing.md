## Development

The stable branch for the IFRC Go application is `develop`. All PRs intended for deployment should be merged into the `develop` branch.

For long-running features, create PRs targeting the specific `project/project-x` branch when working on features related to that project.

### Prerequisites

To begin, ensure you have network access. Then, you'll need the following
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version >=18 / 20+
3. [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)
4. Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build the application.

### Local development

1. Clone the repository using HTTPS, SSH, or Github CLI
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-web-app.git #HTTPS
  git clone git@github.com:IFRCGo/go-web-app.git #SSH
  gh repo clone IFRCGo/go-web-app #Github CLI
  ```
2. Install the dependencies
  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```
3. Copy `app/.env.example` to `app/.env` and update the variables

> [!NOTE]\
> To work on a specific development task, ensure you have the backend setup appropriately and configured properly.
5. Create a new branch for your work.
  ```bash
  git checkout -b name-of-your-branch
  ```
> [!IMPORTANT]\
>  Ensure there are no lint errors before pushing the changes. Ensure the commit message is clear and concise, summarizing the changes made in the commit. Avoid vague and generic messages. Instead, provide specific details that describe the purpose or impact of the changes.
6. Once you're happy with your changes, add and commit them to your branch, then push the branch to origin.
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "some message"
git push -u origin name-of-your-branch
```
> [!NOTE]\
> Before committing and opening a Pull Request, please ensure there are no lint errors. Also please create a pull request only when the feature is ready to be merged.
