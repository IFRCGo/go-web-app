The IFRC Go UI library is a React-based component library developed by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). This open-source library is designed for ease of use and customization, making it an invaluable resource for anyone in the IFRC network to create consistent and user-friendly web applications. Each component is designed to be consistent, customizable and performant.
